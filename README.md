# GeoNotes

## Description
A simple mobile application that allows users to save location based notes on a map. These notes can be displayed on the map where they were saved and viewed by the user that created the note.

## Features
List the main features of your app. For example:
1. Google+ login
2. Display list of notes
3. Location Based
4. Google Maps Clustering

## Technology Stack Used
1. Android (Java)
2. Firebase (Google Login)
3. Firestore (for data persistence)
4. Google Cluster API (to cluster all pointers in that area)
5. Lottie (for animation)
6. MaterialDialog (for displaying saved noted Info)
7. Butterknife (View Injection)

## Commit History
Commits are made at regular intervals and all those can be seen [here](https://github.com/nasreekar/GeoNotes/commits/master)

## Future Updates/Modifications
Many functionalities can either be added or modified to the current application. 
Few of the things that can be either modified or added are:
1. Edit Note functionality
2. Color coding of notes
3. Better Architecture pattern (MVP/MVVM, SOLID etc)

## Bugs
There might be some bugs that would have crept in and went unnoticed while developing, but my highest priority is to implement the functionality as per requirements and these bugs would be fixed in coming updated versions/releases.

## Hiding API Keys
The problem I faced while setting up the repository is I entered the API key in a tracked file and pushed it directly to Github. Checking this into source control can expose your key to the public and And I started receiving emails from GitGuardian that I'm exposing the API keys.

So I had to figure out how to fix this issue and found these articles helpful.
